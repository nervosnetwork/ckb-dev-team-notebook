# Tentacle Go

Due to bottlenecks in the optimization and refactoring of the tentacle, a single viewpoint is no longer sufficient to provide effective feedback Also, the community itself has been asking if there are any other language implementations, so a project to rewrite the library with Go was started.

## Expected goal
- Use actual projects to verify molecule-go
- Use another perspective to examine the tentacle framework
- Verify the possibility of multilingual implementation
- Try to rewrite and refactor schemes in a more radical way
- After completion, we can use the results to reverse the reconstruction of the Rust version
- After the library is available, the later demo verification project can be considered to be quickly implemented with Go
