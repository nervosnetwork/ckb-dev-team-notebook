# CKB Token Issuance Schedule

* **Initial supply**:  33.6B CKB in genesis block, with 8.4B CKBytes immediately burned
* **Base issuance**:  33.6B CKB in total will be issued. Annual base issuance halves every 4 years. This is 4.2B per annum in the first 4 years.
* **Secondary issuance**: 1.344B CKB per annum.

See the [Nervos DAO](Nervos%20DAO.md) [page](https://explorer.nervos.org/nervosdao) in the [CKB Explorer](CKB%20Explorer.md) that almost 70% of secondary issuance will be burned. The total issuance in the first year is about 4.2 + 1.344 * 0.3 = 4.6B.
