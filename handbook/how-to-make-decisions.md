# How to Make Decisions

* Action first on revertible actions.
* Talk with data.
* Research first and give enough context. If there are available solutions, provide detailed pros and cons of these solutions.
* Key result owner can make the decision without approval.
* Write down the decision and the reason in ckb-internal, Quip or Google Doc.
* For the blocking issue, we'll discuss it via meeting until we have a consensus.
