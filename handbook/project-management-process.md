# Project Management Process

## 1:1 Meeting

The team leader will hold 1:1 meeting monthly with each team member.

However if you have urgent issues to discuss, do not wait until the next 1:1
meeting.

## OKR

CKB team follows the OKR process to coordinate the team objectives. We do the planning quarterly. The OKR of the current quarter is available in this repository as a pull request.

## Regular Meetings

We have regular meeting on Monday. We'll limit the meeting time in 50 minutes.

We do planning, progress briefing, retrospectives, brainstorms in meetings.

It's recommended to hold meetings among small groups on demand instead of defer the discussion to the regular meetings.
