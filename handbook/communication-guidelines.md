# Communication Guidelines

We prefer async communication. We prefer GitHub to Telegram.

When in doubt, start the conversation in [ckb-internal](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-internal), and @ the minimal participants. It is also recommended to set the notification level of the ckb-internal to "Not Watching".

We use ckb-internal for:

*   Team-wide announcements
*   Sharing big-picture, strategic ideas
*   Project updates
*   Decision making conversations
*   Conversations that may need extra people later on
*   Long term discussions

If a conversation starts in other places, please archive it into ckb-internal.

If a task requires to involve an outsider members, create a Quip or Google Doc
document, invite the collaborators and share the link in the corresponding
ckb-internal issue.

We don't require immediate responses in GitHub, however do check them daily.

Telegram direct message is the last resort to get a synchronous response. We use telegram to

*   Quickly hash things out
*   Ask a quick question
*   Get fast feedback from a small group
*   Congratulate a teammate
*   To send fun, social notes
*   Private conversations

We encourage flexible work hours. However, it is recommended to be online on 1:30pm ~ 3:30pm (GMT+8) so we can limit the synchronous communication in this time slot, such as various meeting.

We use Google Meet for meetings and sessions. Start a video call immediately for urgent issues and discussions.
